## About

DALL-E Clone is a web application inspired by the original DALL-E project. DALL-E, developed by OpenAI, is an artificial intelligence model that generates images from textual descriptions. This clone project aims to provide a simplified version of DALL-E's functionality, allowing users to generate unique images based on their text inputs.

## Features

- Generate images from text prompts
- Explore the artistic capabilities of the DALL-E model.
- Responsive web design for easy usage on various devices

3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the web server: `npm run dev`
5. Start the client server: `npm start`
6. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

Upon accessing the web application through the provided URL, you will be greeted with a user-friendly interface.

Wait for a few moments while the model processes your input and generates the corresponding image. Once the image is ready, it will be displayed on the screen.
